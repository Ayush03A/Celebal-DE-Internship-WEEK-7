# üöÄ Week 7 Assignment: Daily ETL Pipeline (Date-Stamped File Ingestion & Transformation)



## üìã Project Overview

This project demonstrates a robust, automated ETL solution using **Azure Data Factory (ADF)** designed to handle a common data engineering challenge: ingesting daily files where critical metadata is embedded within the filename.

The pipeline automatically discovers, transforms, and loads multiple types of date-stamped CSV files from an Azure Data Lake into a structured Azure SQL Database, making the data ready for analytics and reporting.

## üéØ Problem Statement

This project addresses the challenge of building a fully automated ETL pipeline to process daily data feeds delivered as CSV files. The core requirements are to extract critical date information embedded in the filenames, apply unique transformation rules for different file types, handle and eliminate duplicate records to ensure data integrity, and implement a daily truncate-and-load pattern into a structured SQL database.

The specific processing logic is summarized below:

| File Type           | Filename Pattern                 | Required Logic                                | Target Table        |
|---------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Customer Master     | `CUST_MSTR_YYYYMMDD.csv`         | Add `Date` column from filename.              | `dbo.CUST_MSTR`     |
| Master-Child Data   | `master_child_export-YYYYMMDD.csv` | Add `Date` & `DateKey` columns from filename. | `dbo.master_child`  |
| E-commerce Orders   | `H_ECOM_ORDER_*.csv`             | Deduplicate by `OrderID` and load data.       | `dbo.H_ECOM_Orders` |

This project implements a solution in Azure Data Factory to solve all of these challenges in a scalable, efficient, and reliable manner.

## üìÇ Project Tasks & Implementation

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Dynamic Ingestion of Date-Stamped CSV Files üìÇüìÖ

**Objective:** Build resilient Data Flows capable of processing all files of a specific type from a source folder, regardless of how many files are present.

#### Steps:
- **Created three distinct Data Flows**, one for each file type (`CUST_MSTR`, `master_child_export`, `H_ECOM_ORDER`).
- Each Data Flow's **Source** was configured with a **Wildcard Path** (e.g., `CUST_MSTR_*.csv`) to dynamically read all matching files in a single operation.
- The `Column to store file name` feature was enabled to capture the filename for transformation.

üì∏ **Evidence:**

- ‚úÖ `DF_Load_CUST_MSTR` Data Flow.

  ![CUST_MSTR Data Flow Preview](https://github.com/Ayush03A/Celebal-DE-Internship-WEEK-7/blob/74d786aacfd8d4b2f0dbac9a352a1e02cbcbc9d5/Screenshots/Data%20Flow%20CUST%20MSTR.png)
  
- ‚úÖ `DF_Load_CUST_MSTR` Data Flow successfully previews data from the source.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Metadata Extraction & Data Transformation ‚ú®

**Objective:** Parse the captured filename to enrich the data with new, structured columns (`Date` and `DateKey`).

#### Implementation:
- **For `CUST_MSTR` files:**
  - A `Derived Column` transformation was used with the expression `toDate(replace(replace(SourceFileName, 'CUST_MSTR_', ''), '.csv', ''), 'yyyyMMdd')` to create a `Date` column.
- **For `master_child_export` files:**
  - A `Derived Column` transformation created two new columns:
    - `DateKey` (Integer): `toInteger(replace(replace(SourceFileName, 'master_child_export-', ''), '.csv', ''))`
    - `Date` (Date): `toDate(replace(replace(SourceFileName, 'master_child_export-', ''), '.csv', ''), 'yyyyMMdd')`
- **For `H_ECOM_ORDER` files (Data Integrity):**
  - An `Aggregate` transformation was used to group by `OrderID` and take the `first()` of all other columns, effectively removing any duplicate records before loading.

üì∏ **Evidence:**

- ‚úÖ `DF_Load_CUST_MSTR` Data Flow successfully creates `Date` column.

- ‚úÖ `DF_Load_master_child` successfully creates both `Date` and `DateKey` columns.

- ‚úÖ `H_ECOM_ORDER` Data Flow using Aggregate to ensure unique OrderIDs.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Automated Truncate-and-Load Pattern üîÑ

**Objective:** Implement a daily full-refresh pattern by automatically clearing the destination tables before loading the new day's data.

#### Implementation:
- **For Data Flows (`CUST_MSTR`, `master_child`):**
  - The **Sink** transformation was configured with the **Table action: Truncate table**. This is the most efficient method within a Data Flow.
- **For `H_ECOM_ORDER` Load:**
  - A dedicated **Script Activity** (`DELETE FROM dbo.H_ECOM_Orders;`) was placed in the pipeline *before* the Data Flow to explicitly handle the data clearing, resolving a primary key violation issue during debugging.

üì∏ **Evidence:**

- ‚úÖ Data successfully loaded and verified in Azure SQL Database.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Pipeline Orchestration and Automation ‚öôÔ∏è

**Objective:** Assemble all processing steps into a single, reliable master pipeline that runs automatically.

#### Implementation:
- A master pipeline (`PL_Load_All_Daily_Files_Sequentially`) was created to run the three data loading processes in sequence.
- **On Success** precedence constraints (the green arrows) ensure that the `master_child` load only starts after `CUST_MSTR` succeeds, and so on.
- A **Schedule Trigger** was configured to run the entire pipeline automatically every day.
- **Monitoring & Alerting** was set up using Azure Monitor to send an email notification upon any pipeline failure.

üì∏ **Evidence:**

- ‚úÖ The complete sequential master pipeline in the ADF canvas.

- ‚úÖ Successful pipeline run monitored in the ADF "Output" tab.

## ‚ùó Challenges Faced & Debugging Journey

- **Initial `BadRequest` Errors:** Encountered generic `BadRequest` errors during Data Flow preview, which were resolved by restarting the **Data Flow Debug cluster** that had timed out.
- **Path Does Not Resolve:** The initial `source1` configuration failed because the Dataset path was incorrect. This was fixed by creating a new, clean dataset pointing to the correct container (`raw`) and directory (`CUST_MSTR`).
- **Primary Key Violation:** The `H_ECOM_Orders` load repeatedly failed with a "Cannot insert duplicate key" error.
  - **Debugging:** We proved the `TRUNCATE` command was succeeding by checking the row count in SQL. This confirmed the issue was with the incoming data having duplicates across files.
  - **Solution:** Replaced the `Copy Data` activity with a **Data Flow** using an **Aggregate transformation** to ensure only unique `OrderID`s are passed to the sink, permanently solving the problem.

## üß† Key Learnings & Next Steps

This project provided deep, hands-on experience in building a real-world ETL solution. Key takeaways include:

- **The Importance of Debugging:** Mastered the use of **Data Preview** to isolate issues at each step of a Data Flow, from source connectivity to transformations.
- **Robust Pipeline Design:** Understood the trade-offs between different pipeline patterns (Wildcard vs. `ForEach` loop).
- **Data Integrity:** Learned to proactively handle potential data quality issues like duplicates using transformations like `Aggregate`.
- **Problem Solving:** Successfully navigated common ADF issues like debug session timeouts and path resolution errors.

### üí° Next Logical Steps

To make this solution even more robust and manageable for production, the next steps would be:

1.  **Performance Optimization (Parallel Execution):** Modify the pipeline to run all three data loads simultaneously, as they are independent. This would significantly reduce the total pipeline run time.
2.  **Advanced Error Handling:** Implement a pattern to catch and log problematic rows or files into a separate "quarantine" location instead of failing the entire pipeline.
3.  **CI/CD Implementation:** Integrate the ADF project with **Azure DevOps** or **GitHub Actions** to automate deployment across different environments (Dev, Test, Prod), enabling a professional software development lifecycle.
4.  **Parameterization for Reusability:** Convert hard-coded values (like folder paths and file prefixes) into pipeline parameters to create a generic, reusable data loading framework.
